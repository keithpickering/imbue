# Imbue

> A responsive, mobile-first theme with everything you need, and nothing you don't

## Status

Imbue has just been started and won't be in a usable state for awhile.

## Features

- Based on the Bulma framework
- Pure HTML5 and CSS3 (with SASS files)
- Vanilla JavaScript only. Leave it how it is, or include a JS library of your choice for feature additions
- Easily customizable through SASS variables
- Reusable components for a variety of common website parts

## The Mission

The consensus among people downloading HTML templates seems to be that Bigger = Better. I can't count the number of templates - specifically WordPress themes - that force you to use a million jQuery plugins you don't need. Everything is javascript, javascript, javascript. Oh, you need to turn that button red instead of blue? Here, use javascript. It's just madness.

JS libraries, especially non-bloated ones, are really cool and they certainly have their place. But when did they become a necessity for every single website? Moreover, if you want to build a site without spending a bazillion hours on it, where do you find a theme that has attractive default styling without relying on a smorgasboard of assets you don't need?

Imbue hears your cries, and it's here to make everything okay.

This theme exists to make your life a little easier without holding your hand. Although small and efficient, it is not lacking in versatility. It can be used to build a variety of popular website layouts, and anyone with basic HTML knowledge can figure it out. Imbue is more than a framework - it has its own sense of style - but it doesn't try to be a top-to-bottom software development package either. It's simply a set of templates you can use to build some of the most oft-repeated web design patterns around today. It can be altered to your heart's content, or it can be used in its original state. Whereas a framework such as Bulma provides you with highly-abstracted components you can turn into a website, Imbue takes care of the busy work for you, providing you with an attractive design and smartly-built layouts you can use right out of the box.

## The Plan

Currently the plan is to release Imbue on a pay-what-you-want model. People buying themes on Themeforest already know what they want - they want the big bloated themes I mentioned earlier. Maybe they'll come around someday. 

If Imbue ever appears in a theme marketplace, it will likely be a WordPress-compatible version. For now I'm just focusing on the holy trinity, HTML, CSS, and good old vanilla JavaScript.

## The part where I beg for cash
