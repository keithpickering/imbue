          <p>We've all seen them. The big themes, the top sellers, the ones that promise you a bucket full of rainbows, the ones that are supposedly so easy to use, even your grandma could do it. 500 HTML files! 600 PSD templates! A whole smorgasboard of bloated, slapped-together jQuery plugins for every occasion!</p>

          <p>And what happens next? The site runs like a potato. All the precious seconds you spend staring at that slick loading spinner give you time to think about how bigger isn't always better. So what's the solution? What kind of theme do you use when you want a head start without including everything but the kitchen sink?</p>

          <p>Enter <strong>Imbue</strong>: a no-nonsense theme for people who don't like their hand to be held, because eww, cooties.</p>
